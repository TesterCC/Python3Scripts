In many applications it is useful to record not only the fingerprints of a document, but also the position of the fingerprints in the document. For example, we need positional information to show the matching substrings in a user interface. An efficient implementation of winnowing also needs to retain the position of the most recently selected fingerprint. Figure 2(f) shows the set of [fingerprint, position] pairs for this example (the first position is numbered 0). To avoid the notational complexity of indexing all hashes with their position in the global sequence of hashes of k-grams of a document, we suppress most explicit references to the position of k-grams in documents in our presentation.
