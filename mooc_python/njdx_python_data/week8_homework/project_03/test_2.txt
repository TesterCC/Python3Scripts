An efficient implementation of winnowing needs to keep the pos of most recently selected fingerprint, too. To avoid the complexity of indexing hashes with position in global sequence of hashes of k-grams in a document. It is very useful in many applications to not only record the fingerprints of documents, but also to record the fingerprints. For example, if we need positions to show the matching substrings in a user's interface.
